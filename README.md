[^1]: Because the O3DS models are unable to run the SNES Virtual Console, a download for a RetroArch forwarder will also be available.
[^2]: These games are not emulated, much like the GBA Virtual Console. In order to run these games, you will need to install the YANBForwarder Pack from Universal-Updater.
[^3]: These games are recommended for N3DS models only. Playing these on O3DS models will result in severe slowdown.
